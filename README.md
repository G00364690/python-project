# python-project
This repository captures the contents of the term project submission of  Declan Reidy for the Programming and Scripting module for Higher Diploma in Data Analytics 2018

## Intial thoughts
The initial impression of the project is to break the requirements down into bitesize snippets. At first pass I'd like to attempt to write my own functions for the Average, Mean, Standard Deviation as well as Max and Min. First port of call has been: https://www.bigskyassociates.com/blog/bid/356764/5-Most-Important-Methods-For-Statistical-Data-Analysis

## Further investigation
Upon investigation over the past number of weeks it has become clear that several packages available for import into anaconda will best fulfil the brief of this project. Initially focusing on the scripting elements of the course led me to investigate writing my own functions. With time and reflection I came to the conclusion that the point of this project was to begin to think bigger and discover the power of python and it's associated libraries for data analysis.

## Investigative sources
Combining some research of how others have tackled this problem with a lot of learning around basic definitions of libraries and what they can offer for data analysis, led me to a common approach adopted by many. These analysts have used combinations of the Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn imported libraries and some basic python commands to generate strong analyses and inflenced me to conduct my analysis in this way using basic statistical information and some relevant graphical plotting. My research and influences for this project are listed in Initial Research.

## Getting started
In order to get started in earnest I first began by reading my data file into Python. I found through research that a common and simple method to do this was by using the import csv library. To ensure I was indeed reading the correct file, I ran a simple test to check the first number of lines using the .head() command. This validated I was reading the correct file. You can find my attempts to get started in the First Steps Summary file

## Investigative method

### Method 1
As highlighted in Initial Research, the consensus methods of creating a data analysis tend to begin with basic concepts such as reading from a file of data, and performing some basic statistical analysis of the data within. Referenced in Further Research.py, my initial pass I focused on
1. Mean
2. Min
3. Max
4. Variance
5. Standard Deviation
6. Count

A very high level commentary can be formed based on these statistical findings, but at this very raw level it is difficult without a strong flair for statistics to truly draw and any real conclusions, so we need a more robust visualization technique to help us uncover what the data is really telling us about the entities it summarizes.

### Method 2
We need to find ways to
